# Visual maze solver

A maze solving visualizer, using the BFS algorithm.

### Settings

In the constants file, you can find two settings,
  - `DEFAULT_SIZE` which the default size of the matrix
  - `MAX_SIZE` which is the max size the app can accept
  - `DELAY` which is the delay time in milliseconds

```ts
// src/constants.ts

export const DEFAULT_SIZE = 10
export const MAX_SIZE = 30
export const DELAY = 0
```
