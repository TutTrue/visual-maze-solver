# Visual maze solver

A maze solving visualizer, using Dijkstra's algorithm.

### Settings

In the constants file, you can find two settings, `DEFAULT_SIZE` which the default size of the matrix, and `DELAY` which is the delay time in milliseconds.

```ts
// src/constants.ts

export const DEFAULT_SIZE = 10
export const DELAY = 0
```
